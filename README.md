# fire-in-manhattan
Python Application developped in group of 4 during the first year of engineering program at the ENAC

You can launch the application with the command line '> python3 main.py'

This was a 4 months project where my group and I had to help the fire fighters in Manhattan to go from their station to a house on fire in Manhattan.
We made this application with Qt and we implemented Dijsktra- and A*-algorithms.
